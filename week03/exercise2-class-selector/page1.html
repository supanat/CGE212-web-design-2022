        <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> is a 2017 action-adventure game developed and published by
        <strong>Nintendo</strong> for
        the Nintendo Switch and Wii U consoles. <em>Breath of the Wild</em> is the nineteenth installment of The Legend of Zelda
        franchise and is set at the end of the Zelda timeline. The player controls Link, who awakens from a hundred-year
        slumber to defeat Calamity Ganon and restore the kingdom of Hyrule.

        Similar to the original 1986 The Legend of Zelda game, players are given little instruction and can explore the
        world freely. Tasks include collecting various items and gear to aid in objectives such as puzzle-solving or
        side quests. The world is unstructured and designed to encourage exploration and experimentation, and the main
        story quest can be completed in a nonlinear fashion.

        Development of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> took place over five years, following the responses from some fans who wanted
        a larger game world to explore. Wanting to rethink the conventions of the series, Nintendo introduced elements
        such as an open world and detailed chemistry and physics engines. Monolith Soft, known for their work on the
        open world Xenoblade Chronicles series, assisted in designing landscapes and topography. The game was originally
        planned for release in 2015 as a Wii U exclusive but was delayed twice. Released on March 3, 2017, Breath of the
        Wild was a launch game for the Nintendo Switch and the final Nintendo-published game for the Wii U. Two waves of
        downloadable content were released throughout 2017 in an expansion pass.
